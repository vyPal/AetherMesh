# AetherMesh
AetherMesh is an innovative, lightweight networking solution that enables IP-like communication over ESP-NOW, creating a seamless bridge between ESP devices and the broader internet.

## Features
- ESP-NOW Based: Utilizes the efficient ESP-NOW protocol for peer-to-peer communication between ESP devices.
- Mesh Networking: Implements a broadcast mesh topology for extended range and resilience.
- IP-like Connectivity: Supports both TCP-like and UDP-like communication protocols.
- Internet Bridging: Enables ESP devices to access the internet through a dedicated bridge node. _(Being worked on)_
- Compact Packet Structure: Optimized for ESP-NOW's 250-byte packet limit.
- Routing Protocol: Includes a simple distance-vector routing mechanism for efficient packet forwarding.

## Use Cases
- IoT networks in areas with limited Wi-Fi coverage
- Low-power, long-range sensor networks
- Ad-hoc networks for emergency communications
- Experimentation and education in network protocols and mesh topologies

## Current Status
This project is currently a proof-of-concept, focusing on demonstrating the feasibility of creating an internet-like experience over ESP-NOW. While not optimized for speed or production use, it serves as a foundation for exploring novel networking approaches with ESP devices.

## Contributions
We welcome contributions and ideas to enhance AetherMesh's functionality, efficiency, and applicability. Join us in pushing the boundaries of what's possible with ESP-NOW and mesh networking!
